            Put out local advertisements to purchase used
            Smartphones. Then refurbished them to sell on eBay.
            I would often order
            cases, chargers, headphones, etc in bulk to then
            list the Smartphones as bundle deals.
            Learned about Smartphone hardware, IMEIs,
            ecommerce, shipping, bill of sales,
            phone carriers, and much more.

            Worked in the drive through cashier for
            most of my shifts.
            This included packaging items, preparing drinks,
            handling transactions, serving customers
            I also worked in the food preperation
            but not as much involved. Often I would
            stock the drinks, prep frozen foods,
            clean dishes, and take out the trash.

            Worked as a Dish Washer.
            Usually would handwash the bigger items
            like pots and pans. Then operate
            a industrial dishwasher for the plates and such.
            At closing, I would have to clean every dish,
            cookware, surface, etc in the kitchen and
            mop the floors.
