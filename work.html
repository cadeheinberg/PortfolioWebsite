            Abstrakt AI uses OpenAI to give real time suggestions to agent swhile talking with customers over the phone.
            Team managers can create playbooks that they want their
            agents to follow while on call. Then through our web portal users can view insights
            and analytics on how their agents are performing.

            My role involves full stack engineering, but I primarily work on the NodeJS backend,
            MongoDB and BigQuery databases, and implementing client integrations and API security.
            <br><br>
            I am in charge of developing, testing and maintaining several integrations which allow
            customers to use our service from different clients (typically a VOIP service such as
            Vici, smrtPhone, Five9, etc). This involves meetings with customers, configuring their
            client scripts, and updating our NodeJS backend. My changes have increased the
            scalability and efficiency of these integrations, allowing us to bring in more customers.
            <br><br>
            I targeted our most crucial API services and converted them
            into using Google BigQuery instead of MongoDB which is much faster for data science/analysis.
            The biggest challenge was designing and implementing a real-time sync to reflect
            the MongoDB changes in BigQuery.
