		Sushi is my favorite food. The first time I had sushi was with my girlfriend
		<br>
		when I was a sophomore in highschool. Although I didn't like it that much at
		<br>
		first, it has become my all time favorite food and my all time favorite roll
		<br>
		is the Dragon Roll
		<br>
		<br>
		Yogurt and applesauce are my favorite side items. Vanilla Greek yogurt is my
		<br>
		favorite yougurt.
